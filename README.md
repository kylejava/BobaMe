Hello! I am a Sophomore at CSUSM,
I was messing around with the Yelp API
and started to make a simple program that Would
allow the user to find Boba shop locations in certain
zip codes or cities.

I was really into app development and decided to dedicate an app to it!

I tried to learn the language Swift, but failed.

Then I found Kivy! A Python framework capable of creating GUI
apps for OS X, IOS, Android, and Windows.

I hope this app helps you find your next favorite bubble
tea shop!
